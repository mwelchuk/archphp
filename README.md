ArchPHP: A PHP based dynamic website for archery clubs

To install copy the contents of the php directory to a php and mysql enabled
webserver. The contents of base.sql.gz contains the basic structure of the
mysql database, which will need to be loaded into your mysql server.

I have included ArcheryDB.sxd, which is an openoffice drawing representation
of the database structure.
